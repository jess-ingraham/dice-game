# A Simple Dice Game
###This game was created by Jessica Ingraham for a previous course.

#### The objective
This game is played against the computer. The point is to get the lowest score

All dice, except 3's, have a value equivalent to their face values. 3's have a value of 0.

Your score is the sum of all the dice you have pinned.

#### The game rules are as follows:
* Select "Go" to go to the game page
* Select "Start" to start the game and generate the computer score
* For each turn select "Roll"
	* Click on a dice to choose to pin it
	* You must choose at least one die to pin
	* Click "Pin" to pin the dice and calculate your score
* If there is only one die left, it will automatically be pinned no matter the die roll

#### Predefined Rolls
On the start page there is an area for predefined rolls. To use this function enter a common seperated list of numbers 1-6.

Up to the first 15 rolls will be considered "computer rolls" and will be used instead of random numbers. The lowest of the first 5 will be chosen, then the lowest of the next 4, and so on. If there are less than 15 rolls, the rest will be random. If there are more than 15 rolls, they will be applied to the player rolls.

This is an optional feature and can be ignored for a completely random game.
